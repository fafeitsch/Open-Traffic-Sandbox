Open Traffic Sandbox
=====================

What is _Open Traffic Sandbox_?
-------------------------------

At the moment it is just a curious side project of mine. The project is about maps and traffic, but
as of now, I do not know where it is headed. Except if you are *very* curious, this
project is not yet meant to be executed by the public. 

What will happen if I run some code in the repository?
------------------------------------

The repository consists of two code bases: The backend, written in the Go progamming language,
and the frontend, written in Angular. If you run any of these without prior configuration,
there most likely will be errors. You can read here for setting up a working environment.

Disclaimer
------------------------------------
This repository is about public transportation. As test data, I set up
a scenario in the city of Wuerzburg (Bavaria, Germany). This scenario is fictional,
thus, do not use the data of this repository for real routing!

I don't mean any harm with my code. However, I do not take any responsibilities that
may come as consequences of executing the code on this repository on your computer.
