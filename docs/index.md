## Open Transport Sandbox

Open Transport Sandbox (OTS) aims to be an open source simulation platform/framework.
As of November 2020, it is in a very early stage of development and has only a limited set of features.
At the moment, there is no official release version. It is possible to checkout and
run the code, but for this, [some effort](dev_config.md) must be taken.

### Features

Already implemented:

* Definition of simple timetables.
* Definition of buses with assignments (e.g. when to serve a certain line).
* Buses serve their assignments, and their locations are shown on a map.
* To define stops, real OSM data can be used (gson format).

Planned for the future:

* Incorporating passengers with routes that use the buses.
* More information in the frontend.
* More guidance for creating scenarios.
